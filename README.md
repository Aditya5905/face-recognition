# Face Recognition using CNN  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Face Recognition system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained to identify and verify human faces with high accuracy.  
The system can be used in applications like **security authentication, attendance systems, and smart surveillance**.

## 🚀 Features  
- Face detection and recognition using deep learning  
- Built with a custom **CNN architecture**  
- Support for multiple classes (faces of different individuals)  
- Real-time face recognition using webcam (optional)  
- Achieves high accuracy on test data

## 🏗️ Project Architecture  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Image resizing and normalization  
   - Label encoding for different identities  

2. **Model Architecture (CNN)**  
   - Convolutional layers for feature extraction  
   - Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
   - Fully connected layers for classification  

3. **Training**  
   - Optimizer: Adam  
   - Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy  
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy  

4. **Prediction**  
   - Input face image → Model → Predicted Identity
