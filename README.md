# Face Recognition using CNN  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Face Recognition system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained to identify and verify human faces with high accuracy.  
The system can be used in applications like **security authentication, attendance systems, and smart surveillance**.
